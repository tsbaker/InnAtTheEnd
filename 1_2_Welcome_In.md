Gar's golden eye's adjusted like the predator his ancestors had been to the nearly unlit room that he pushed open the heavy door. The giant oak tree in the center of the room drew his gaze. It always does. The Oak tree in the heart of the room was covered in pointed leaves of dull green. This was not the smooth turtle shell green of an oak tree in summer. This elegant tree is a Season Oak in the fall of a centuries long life. He smiled, showing two pointed teeth that peaked through full lips. He drew in a long full breath, smelling the aromas sitting softly on the still morning air.

There was the slight tang of pine torch smoke. A hint of dampness, like sodden leaves just barely pricked his bottom two nostrils. The dominant smell was the cool flat gray of a dying fire, not the rich smell of roaring cook fire. He hadn't found what he was looking for yet. He closed his eyes and flared his nostrils so that it looked as if his face would split into three parts.

Ah! there is was. That sweet, fatty smell of a Razorback spit-roasted in it's own juices. The full ton king hog of the wide open Prarea was the centerpiece of all good frontier hospitality, least in these parts. The shorter and tougher ones would be buried underground for days with stones that had had been heated in a fire until the first one split. These were of course tasty, but could sometimes yield mouthfuls that bit back so to speak. Most of the collected flotsam and jetsam that washed up on this opposite shore of the inland dirt sea could passably cook one of these, if they were patient enough and didn't mind giving some parts unfortunately blackened to feed their companion animals. Even then, the great wild beast would taste faintly of game, with some amount of toughness retained.

But a real cook, master of both blade and ladle could really do something special with a wild pig this size. Of course, it was not enough to be an insightful hash slinger. You also needed to have a strong back. The best of these beasts weighed almost a ton, young and full of vim and vinegar. When one of these young boars got a whiff of a root cellar, he was liable to knock down and uproot the whole house. Trying to take it down from the front was no good, for the tusk like and toothy front. Attacking from the rear was no good either, since God had seen fit to give this living bulldozer a spine covered in a half foot wide covering of foot long quills that gave the pig its name. These pigs had a nasty habit of rolling to crush anything that tried to sneak up on it. If the weight didn't crush you, the poison tipped quills usually did. If you did get lucky, or happen to have a large posse of lancers with you, these hogs could be fruitfully flambeed and filleted to feed a small town. The full bellied neighbor would generally open up their pocketbooks to help ensure that the now homeless would not stay that way for long.

Fartown did not have anything like a militia full of lancers, but they were lucky. Gar'esh Kinabaara didn't know it, but this particular 'back had knocked down the mayor's frame house, dropping the floor beam right onto it's poor back. All that Gar knew was that this was something special. He open his eyes and looked for it again. It was not on big five foot stone hearth standing on the far side of the room, leading to the center of the house. The pig couldn't be seen from behind the bar, with kegs stacked neatly behind, tapped and waiting.

He sniffed again. Yes, there it was, the smell of the best parts of bacon, ham and pork all rolled into one. Just a hint of nutmeg, plenty of mustard seed and the garlic. Oh the garlic was the best part. It was like catnip to a road weary troll. He couldn't tell if it was more funny or annoying that he thought he was so famished from the road that he would have even eaten mushrooms right now, if they were covered in garlic.

He kept searching the large single chambered room for the smell. His long  strides took him past the high stools near the door and into the midst of the long low tables in between the bar and the Season Oak. The benches were mostly empty, except for one shaggy customer snoring happily with his head between his arms over at the table, his plate still half covered in the remains of the night's dinner. The big troll glanced at him, wondering why this ruffian wasn't in his bed. Gar himself would never spend a night outside of his 8 poster bed if it he could at all avoid it. But, he supposed it may be normal. The errant snoozer was a werewolf after all. "I supposed that I should be grateful he isn't sprawled out on the hearth" he muttered to noone in particular. He started a little and stopped to stare when the canid grunted as if he had heard the dismissive. No, he assured himself while smoothing down his riding coat. The shaggy wolfman was just snoring in his restless dreams, its tail wagging quickly as if on the hunt. "Probably chasing jackalopes through that big field in the sky".

His stomach rumbled as he was reminded about food once more. He eyed the plate of half eaten ribs infront of the happy customer. His hunger turned to jealousy as he tried to catch a whiff of the spices on the cold but still tender scraps. Was this what he had smelled? What if there wasn't anymore left?

He looked up as the door cracked open and a funny looking human in a gray bowler hat and mustache pushed his way backward into the room. When he turned around he looked up at the mountain of craggly stone in his dining room. The barman twitched his curly waxed mustache and turned back to the door he had pushed through. "Ay, Cookie! Some'uns here to see you." With that he turned back and carried the bucket over to his bar and started scrubbing the already pristine bar down with a soapy rag.

A long white beard poked it's way out of the swinging double doors, followed by a hooked nose, then a large pair of round blue eyes. "Well I'll be, if it isn't Garesh Kin-e-bar, hold your horses I'll be right out to see ya. Wait, you must be starvin', let me grab ya somethin' ta eat." The doors slammed shut. Gar was left standing there with the silent bar man  He shifted his feet, then tried to put a little bit of discreet distance between himself and the snoring werewolf. He looked over at the bar, hoping to make eye contact, but he never looked up. After exactly 34 heartbeats Gar decided that he was going to have to look somewhere else. His feet would probably be the best place for now, while he waited. And waited.

For someone like you or me, those in between moments stretch and weave like an eternity. Not for a troll. Trolls are naturally attuned to the passing of time. Some of the nastier specimens of humans claimed that a troll in sunlight would turn to stone, preferring this pseudo-magical explanation to the simple fact that a 7 foot monster needed to spend every minute of daylight in correspondence with his numerous far flung trading partners. The relative prices of nearly a thousand different crops, exotics and trade goods needed to be swapped, compared, and updated in the bridge-ledger to ensure that no traveling merchant was charged more than his or her fair share.

These prices and carriage fees had to be cajoled, begged and bargained from a network of nearly two score trolls throughout the Eastern Waste. This was a necessary bargain because even a single merchant who felt cheated at a troll bridge could shift his lucrative carriage business to a neighboring road, or worse, continue adding to the unfortunate lies and rumors that surrounded such an influential class of merchants.
